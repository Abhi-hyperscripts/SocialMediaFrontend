# Location Tracker PWA - Installation Guide

## 📱 What is a PWA?

A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web application that can be installed on your phone or desktop like a native app, without needing the App Store or Google Play Store. Users can install it directly from their browser!

## 📦 Files Included

1. **index.html** - Your main application file (updated with PWA support)
2. **manifest.json** - App configuration file (name, icons, colors, etc.)
3. **sw.js** - Service worker for offline functionality and caching
4. **icon-generator.html** - Tool to generate app icons

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Generate App Icons

1. Open `icon-generator.html` in your web browser
2. Click "Download 192x192" and "Download 512x512" buttons
3. Save both icon files (`icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`)

### Step 2: Upload to Web Server

Upload all files to your web server:
- index.html
- manifest.json
- sw.js
- icon-192.png
- icon-512.png

**Important:** Your website MUST use HTTPS (not HTTP) for PWA features to work. Most modern hosting services provide free SSL certificates.

### Step 3: Test Your PWA

1. Visit your website on a mobile device using Chrome, Safari, or Edge
2. You should see an "Install" banner appear
3. Alternatively, tap the browser menu (three dots) and look for "Install App" or "Add to Home Screen"
