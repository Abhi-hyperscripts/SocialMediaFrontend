# üéØ ACTION PLAN - Fix Your 404 Error

## DO THESE STEPS IN ORDER

### STEP 1: Upload test.html First
**This will tell us if GitHub Pages is working at all.**

1. Download `test.html` from the files I provided
2. Go to your GitHub repository
3. Click "Add file" ‚Üí "Upload files"
4. Upload `test.html`
5. Click "Commit changes"
6. Wait 2 minutes
7. On your Android phone, visit:
   ```
   https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/test.html
   ```

**‚ùì What do you see?**

- ‚úÖ **"GitHub Pages is Working!"** ‚Üí Great! Go to STEP 2
- ‚ùå **404 Error** ‚Üí GitHub Pages isn't configured. Do this:
  - Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
  - Set Source to: Deploy from branch
  - Set Branch to: main
  - Set Folder to: / (root)
  - Save and wait 3 minutes, then try test.html again

---

### STEP 2: Check Your Files
**Make sure you have ALL these files uploaded:**

Upload these 7 files to your GitHub repository ROOT (not in any folder):

1. ‚úÖ `index.html` - Main app
2. ‚úÖ `manifest.json` - PWA config
3. ‚úÖ `sw.js` - Service worker
4. ‚úÖ `test.html` - Test page (you just uploaded this)
5. ‚úÖ `diagnostics.html` - Diagnostic tool
6. ‚ùå `icon-192.png` - **YOU NEED TO GENERATE THIS!**
7. ‚ùå `icon-512.png` - **YOU NEED TO GENERATE THIS!**

**Generate the icons:**
1. Download `icon-generator.html`
2. Open it in your browser (any browser, any computer)
3. Click "Download 192x192"
4. Click "Download 512x512"
5. Upload both PNG files to GitHub repository root
6. Commit

---

### STEP 3: Run Diagnostics
**This will tell us exactly what's wrong.**

1. On your Android phone, visit:
   ```
   https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/diagnostics.html
   ```

2. Click ALL the check buttons:
   - Check Manifest
   - Check Service Worker
   - Check Icons

3. **TELL ME:** Which ones show ‚ùå red X marks?

Write down what you see:
- HTTPS Status: ___________
- Manifest Status: ___________
- Service Worker Status: ___________
- Icon Status: ___________

---

### STEP 4: Fix What's Broken

Based on diagnostics results:

**If Manifest shows ‚ùå:**
- File missing or wrong path
- Re-upload manifest.json to repository ROOT
- Make sure it's named exactly `manifest.json` (lowercase)

**If Service Worker shows ‚ùå:**
- File missing or wrong path
- Re-upload sw.js to repository ROOT
- Make sure it's named exactly `sw.js` (lowercase)

**If Icons show ‚ùå:**
- Icons missing - YOU MUST GENERATE THEM (see Step 2)
- This is the most common issue!

### STEP 5: Clear Cache and Try Again

On Android:
1. Chrome Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Clear browsing data
2. Select "Cached images and files" + "Site settings"
3. Time range: All time
4. Clear data
5. Close Chrome completely
6. Reopen and visit your site

---

### STEP 6: Try the Main App

Visit your main app:
```
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/
```

**What happens?**
- ‚úÖ **Page loads!** ‚Üí Success! Continue to Step 7
- ‚ùå **404 Error** ‚Üí index.html is missing or not committed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Page loads but errors** ‚Üí Check console for errors

---

### STEP 7: Install the PWA

If page loads successfully:

**On Android Chrome:**
1. Tap menu (‚ãÆ)
2. Look for "Install app" or "Add to Home Screen"
3. Tap it
4. Tap "Install"

**OR** wait for the install banner to appear automatically.

## üÜò IF STILL NOT WORKING

**Tell me:**

1. **Your GitHub username:** ________________
2. **Your repository name:** ________________
3. **What does test.html show?** (Working / 404)
4. **What does diagnostics.html show?** (Which checks failed?)
5. **Do you have icon-192.png and icon-512.png uploaded?** (Yes / No)
6. **Screenshot of your GitHub repository file list** (if possible)

**Common Issues:**

‚ùå **Files in wrong place**
- Files must be in root, not in `docs/` or any subfolder
- Check: Can you see all files on main repository page?

‚ùå **Missing icons** 
- Most common issue!
- You MUST generate and upload both icon files

‚ùå **GitHub Pages not enabled**
- Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Enable it
- Wait 2 minutes after enabling

‚ùå **Using wrong URL**
- Must be: `username.github.io/repo-name/`
- Not just: `username.github.io/`

‚ùå **Not waiting for deployment**
- After each change, wait 2 minutes
- Check Actions tab for green checkmark

‚ùå **Case sensitivity**
- `index.html` ‚úÖ 
- `Index.html` ‚ùå
- File names must be exact lowercase

## üöÄ QUICK REFERENCE

**Your URLs should be:**
```
Main app:        https://username.github.io/repo-name/
Test page:       https://username.github.io/repo-name/test.html
Diagnostics:     https://username.github.io/repo-name/diagnostics.html
